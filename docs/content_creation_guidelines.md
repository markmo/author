# Content Creation Guidelines

1. **Organise around intent.** Define intents (at least a candidate list) upfront. Example intents
   include:
   * Activate
   * Install
   * Power-up
   * Shutdown
   * Configure
   * Troubleshoot
   * Assure
   * Disable
   * Share

2. **Consistent entity terminology and format.** Entities are people, places and things â€“ the objects of 
   the content. Typically, answers are found at the intersection of an Intent and one or more entities. 
   Examples of entities include:
   * "Netgear v7610"
   * PSTN
   * "USB 3.0"
   * "Wireless Key"
   * Home
   * Work
   * Apple
   * Front

   For example, the question: _"Does the Netgear v7610 have 802.11 AC?"_, involves the intent _"Configure"_ 
   and the entities _"Netgear v7610"_, _"Wi-Fi"_, and _"802.11 AC"_. Therefore, being able to identify the 
   entities of a piece of content will facilitate finding it to solve some task-specific enquiry. The 
   following guidelines facilitate entity identification:

   * **Consistent use of terminology.** For example, avoid synonyms where possible. Use "Solid Green" 
     instead of "solid green" or "steady green".
   * **Capitalise entities.** While preserved for pronouns in everyday writing, capitalising all entities 
     helps machine learning algorithms identify them. The use of capitalisation should not detract from 
     readability; it should help people scan the information more quickly. It also potentially saves the 
     need to manually tag relevant entities.
